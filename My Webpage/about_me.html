        <p class="p2">I am a 22 year old college graduate. I attended the Unoversity of Maryland of Baltimore County.
        I recieved my undergraduate degree in Biology with a minor in critical sexuality studies. I have two dogs and have been
        spending quarantine learning to code. So far, I have completed projects in this cs50 course, including c, python, sql,
        html, css, and R. Coding has opened my eyes to so many possibilities and reignited my passion for public health.</p>
