        <p class="p6">Although coronavirus dramatically altered my plans, I still plan on taking the gre and going to grad school.
        My future plans include getting my masters degree in Epidemiology and gaining experience as a data scientist. My future
        careet goals involve conducting research and solving problems with data alongside a team. I want to start a non-profit
        in my birth place of Baltimore for young girls in the community. I want to share my experience growing up and help others
        as they work on achieveing their goals.</p>
        <br>
